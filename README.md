# Maze-Solver

Implementation of an idea discussed in a Computerphile video. Solve an NxN maze that is given in a picture format where one pixel represents either a wall or a hall. Libraries used for implementation are PIL (for image parsing), NetworkX (graph management) and matplotlib for drawing a path. Using NetworkX you can compare different graph pathfinding algorithms and their differences.
